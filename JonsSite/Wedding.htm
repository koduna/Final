        <h2>The Location</h2>
        <p>
          The wedding will be taking place in the Holiday Inn in Fairborn, Ohio (shown above). This place actually has no significant meaning to us,
          however we decided on this location because it is near our graduation spot, the Nutter Center, and it is a new spot to start our new lives.
        </p>
        <h2>The location details</h2>
        <p>
          The ceremony will take place on the grass shown above, facing towards the building near a garden area. It will be in the spring so the flowers
          should be in full bloom and the grass should be nice and green, similar to how it is shown (the photo was taken in the spring the previous year).
          The reception will be taking place inside, in a large ball room area, with a dance floor, and tables that will be pre set up for us. This area is
          also the backup area for us if it rains on the day of the wedding. The location itself is a hotel, but has a high class restaurant inside and is
          built more for the use of events than for the use of people taking vacations, as the area is near the Wright Patterson Air Force base. For more
