        <h2>How We Met</h2>
        <p>
          We met in high school, specifically we met in some of our classes in Sophmore year.
          We both knew ths one friend of both of ours, and one of the classes we all three
          shared, I kept taking our friend's seat just to be annoying to him. Her first
          impression was me as an annoying and weird guy who knew one of her friends.
          (not the greatest first impression). This however was not the last time we
          shared classes and friends. Junior year, we had a psychology class together with one
          of her band friends that I was also friends with. We all three started to become a
          group, talking and lauging everyday. That was how we met. But the next part is even
          better.
        </p>
        <h2>How we began to date and later got engaged</h2>
        <p>
          Junior year prom was not something I had even planned on attending. I was not much of
          a social butterfly. However, one friend of mine that I thought would never have a date,
          stated that he had a date, so therefore I had to see for myself that he did. I couldn't
          believe it at all. Leah was going to just be with friends of hers. There at the dance
          she looked so beautiful that I couldn't help but compliment her on that, and eventually
          ask her to dance with me to a slow song that came on. Since then I asked her out, and
          not to long after we got out of highschool I could begin to see my future with her in it.
          I saved up enough money for an ok ring and took her to the high school to ask her to be my
          wife. She said yes. That is how we got here today.
